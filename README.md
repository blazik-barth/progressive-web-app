# Progressive Web App
 A simple progressive web app, built as a class project.

 In contrast to my other web application (found under the Trubbish-Collector repository), this application was built to show off my knowledge of HTML and CSS, including Material design elements, fetching various different elements from an API, storage workers and manifests, and data storage via Dexie.

 The project consists of four tabs. The first three tabs act as a database of Pokemon stats.
 On the first tab, the user selects from a list of each Pokemon type.
 On the second tab, the user is shown a list of cards corresponding to each Pokemon of that type.
 On the third tab, the user sees an image of that Pokemon, as well as colored bars corresponding to the Pokemon's base stats.
 The fourth tab simply shows the user's current physical location, and was included to satisfy project requirements.

 HTML was used to display the various elements of the app, while CSS was used to properly position and center the elements. Javascript was primarily used to create functions to create and remove elements from the screen.

 This project was created as part of the curriculum for CS 294, Web App Development, during the spring 2022 semester at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Template code was provided by Dexie, David Hayes, Replit, and Google, but the majority of the code was created by myself, Barth Blazik.
